PiggyBank Driver directions:

1) Create a Piggy Bank object, passing 3 pennies, 4 nickels, 5 dimes,
   and 6 quarters into the constructor.

2) Print out the current number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and
   quarters, and then how much $$$ you have in your bank
   (you're calling 5 methods here).

3) Add 2 pennies, 3 nickels, 4 dimes, and 5 quarters to your bank.

4) Print out how many of each coin you added (these aren't method calls),
   and then the current number of p, n, d, q, and $$$ in your bank.

SOP("After adding 2 pennies, etc, we now have " + ???.getPennies() + " pennies " ....);
5) Repeat 1-4 by calling your default constructor (except you won't be
   passing any coins in here).  Copy-pasting here is ok.

* Try to "beautify" your output by adding spaces to line things up

Output:

Initial piggy bank stats:

	Quarters:  6
	Dimes:	   5
        Nickels:   4
        Pennies:   3

        Total:     $2.23


After adding 5 quarters, 4 dimes, 3 nickels, and 2 pennies,


Current piggy bank stats:

	Quarters:  11
	Dimes:	   9
        Nickels:   7
        Pennies:   5

        Total:     $4.05


Same for the default constructor
